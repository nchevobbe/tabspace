# tabspace

This is an attempt to re-create a TabGroup/Panorama-like web extension.

![Early screenshot](assets/screenshot.jpg?raw=true "Early screenshot")

## Run the extension

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run start:firefox`

Because it uses web-ext CLI, changes to the code will be automatically picked up.

## Warning

This is an early version, here is what **do not work**:
- Creating new space
- Navigating to space
- Moving tabs

So yeah, basically a static version with made-up Spaces.
